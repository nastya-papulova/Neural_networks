# Neural Networks Laboratory Works

## Overview

This repository contains three laboratory assignments focused on practical implementations of different neural network architectures:

## Lab 1: Image Classification with CNNs

-   **Task**: Classification of street view house numbers using convolutional neural networks
    
-   **Models**: Implemented and compared different CNN architectures 
    
-   **Dataset**: SVHN (Street View House Numbers)

    

## Lab 2: Fake News Detection with RNNs

-   **Task**: Binary classification of news articles as real or fake
    
-   **Models**: Implemented recurrent neural networks (LSTM, GRU) with word embeddings
    
-   **Dataset**: Fake News Dataset from Kaggle
    
-   **Key Techniques**: Text preprocessing, sequence modeling, attention mechanisms
    

## Lab 3: Image Generation with GANs

-   **Task**: Generative modeling of fashion items
    
-   **Models**: Implemented Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)
    
-   **Dataset**: Fashion MNIST
